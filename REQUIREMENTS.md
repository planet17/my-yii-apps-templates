# NOTES:
Is it useful to invalidate cookies on different media:
Firstly, when a password has changed, it is for a reason.
Secondly, the disadvantage is minor. Users will understand to relogin on other media after a password change. This is quite expectable and with the new password in short memory, this wouldnt have to be.
Thirdly, safety above all (or at lease provide an config option in User)
